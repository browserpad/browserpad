# Browserpad [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/browserpad/browserpad.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/browserpad/browserpad)

An open-source, browser-based plain text editor built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

> http://browserpad.org

Browserpad will always be a
   **[plaintext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor#Plain_text_files_vs._word_processor_files)** editor:
   no markdown/html preview, no WYSIWIG, no rich text editing.
Think a browser-based [notepad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29)
   with a few extra text manipulation features.
The aim of this guiding principle is to prevent feature creep
   and keep the tool focused,
   the [Unix way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Doug_McIlroy_on_Unix_programming):
   do one thing, and do it well.

### Origins / inspiration:
* Browserpad [started](https://github.com/browserpad/browserpad/commit/d71b37b)
  [up](https://github.com/browserpad/browserpad/commit/324ef38)
  as a very simple browser notepad entirely contained in a data URI:
  `data:text/html,<textarea autofocus style='width:100%;height:100%;border:none;outline:none'/>`
  (try copying and pasting that to your browser address bar and pressing enter).
  This concept was originally decribed by [@jjperezaguinaga](https://github.com/jjperezaguinaga)
  on his 4 Dec 2012 post "[One line browser notepad](https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq/one-line-browser-notepad)".
    * Actually, it appears that it had been previously uncovered by [@tabatkins](https://github.com/tabatkins),
      as evidenced by [this 29 Jan 2012 tweet](https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/163692631128424449)
      by [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish).
    * [This 9 December 2011 Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3333093)
      by [@bytex64](https://github.com/bytex64) mentions a talk about HTML5 where this was presented
    * TODO: contact @tabatkins and @bytex64 to investigate this further and get to the bottom of it
      (although maybe this may be irrelevant if we abandon the Data URI concept,
      not to mention it is definitely not small anymore;
      but it may still be nice to have the origins of Browserpad documented).
* The data URI approach was neat, but impractical,
  and was [eventually abandoned](https://github.com/browserpad/browserpad/issues/2)
  in favor of the regular html file approach.
* Browserpad is heavily inspired by the existing (but proprietary) online plaintext editors:
    * [mytextarea.com](http://mytextarea.com)
    * [editpad.org](http://editpad.org)
* In terms of features, Browserpad aims to match most of the text manipulation operations listed/implemented in:
    * [textmechanic.com](http://textmechanic.com)
    * [textop.us](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130718231049id_/http://textop.us/) (defunct)
    * [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor#Typical_features)

### Primary features:
> Note: As a rule of thumb, Browserpad aims to support only editing operations that are generic and content-agnostic.
> This means it won't implement any context-sensitive functions that depend on the semantic meaning of the text,
> such as bracket matching, code linting, etc.

- [x] support tab key
- [x] auto-save using `localStorage` (see [here](https://github.com/JakobKallin/Text-Editor/blob/gh-pages/index.html))
- [x] show statistics (lines/words/characters)
- [ ] indent-deindent (with `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`)
- [ ] keep selection visible (greyed out) when unfocused (see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15523667/266309))

      (see [here](http://iamnotagoodartist.com/web/an-auto-updating-data-uri-text-editor/))
- [ ] menu entries (menu icon: [â‰¡](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2261/browsertest.htm))
   - [ ] contrast (normal / night mode). (see icon [here](http://pixelmack.github.io/slight/))
   - [ ] permalink / share ([via data url](http://iamnotagoodartist.com/web/an-auto-updating-data-uri-text-editor/))
   - [x] save to a file
         (using the [download attribute](http://stackoverflow.com/q/283956/266309) of the `a` element;
         [browser support for the download attribute](http://caniuse.com/#feat=download))
      - [x] save as (custom filename).
   - [x] load from a file on disk (based on [this implementation](https://github.com/itsapi/notepad))

      - [ ] soft-wrap lines at specified CPL
            ([need to wait for FF 36](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/657795/how-remove-word-wrap-from-textarea/13446005#comment43835216_13446005))
   - [ ] highlight current line
   - [ ] text operations (on whole text or selection):
      - [ ] case change (lower/upper/title)
      - [ ] search & replace

- [ ] split window (different views of the same document (or maybe two separate documents?...)
